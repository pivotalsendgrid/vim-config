" How this works:
"
" This file is minimal.  Most of the vim settings and initialization is in
" several files in .vim/init.  This makes it easier to find things and to
" merge between branches and repos.
"
" Please do not add configuration to this file, unless it *really* needs to
" come first or last, like Pathogen and sourcing the machine-local config.
" Instead, add it to one of the files in .vim/init, or create a new one.
